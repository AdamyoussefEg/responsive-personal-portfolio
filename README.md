## ✨ Key Features

* **Fully Responsive Design:** Optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop monitors.
* **Sleek Dark Mode Theme:** A clean, professional aesthetic to make content stand out.
* **Multi-Page Navigation:** Includes Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact sections.
* **Showcase Sections:** Dedicated areas for **Services** (Web Development, Graphic Design, Digital Marketing) and a **Portfolio** gallery for the latest projects.
* **Contact Form Placeholder:** A non-functional contact form (since it's a pure front-end project) with a clear call-to-action.
* **Social Media Integration:** Links to popular platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project is a purely **Frontend** application.

* **HTML5:** For the fundamental structure of the website.
* **CSS3:** Used for styling, layout, and achieving the responsive design.
* **JavaScript:** For any client-side interactivity, such as menu toggles or scroll animations.

> **Note on Backend:** This project is designed purely for the front end. There is **no database**, **no server-side code (like Python or Node.js)**, and the contact form/buttons currently serve as **visual placeholders** and only **refresh the page** when clicked.
